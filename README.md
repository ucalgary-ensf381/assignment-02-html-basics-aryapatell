# HTML Basics
In this assignment, you will create 6 HTML pages for a personal website.

## :foot: Steps
- Clone the repo.
- Add HTML code to the [`about.html`](./about.html) file to create a page like this:
![about](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1673847014/ENSF-381/HTML/About_chru9o.png)
- Add HTML code to the [`skills.html`](./skills.html) file to create a page like this:
![skills](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1673847014/ENSF-381/HTML/Skills_rfyaom.png)
- Add HTML code to the [`education.html`](./education.html) file to create a page like this:
![education](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1673847014/ENSF-381/HTML/Education_kq4swc.png)
- Add HTML code to the [`experience.html`](./experience.html) file to create a page like this:
![experience](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1673847014/ENSF-381/HTML/Experience_pr2zlw.png)
- Add HTML code to the [`interests.html`](./interests.html) file to create a page like this:
![interests](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1673847014/ENSF-381/HTML/Interests_repzys.png)
- Add HTML code to the [`contact.html`](./contact.html) file to create a page like this:
![contact](https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1673847014/ENSF-381/HTML/Contact_fqyoou.png)
- Commit your changes to the `main` branch and don't forget to push it to the remote repo before the deadline.
- All the menu links should open on the same page, but other links (such as LinkedIn or Facebook) should open in a new tab.
- Check the validity of your HTML code (for every page) on [W3C Markup Validation Webpage](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) (use Direct Input). All the pages need to be valid for you to get the full mark. If everything's fine, it will show you this message with a green background:

    ```bash
    Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.
    ```
- Take a screenshot of the no-error-found message along with the source code you tried and add it to the [screenshots](./screenshots/) folder (one for each page). Name the screenshots after the corresponding page. e.g. `about.png`.

### :page_with_curl: Notes
- Don't miss any element on the pages. For instance, if there's an image, you need to have at least one image. If there are 8 checkboxes, you need to have at least 8 checkboxes.
- Feel free to change the contents of the pages. For instance, although you need to have an image on every page, it doesn't have to be the image shown above. You can use any picture you want (keep it family-friendly, though!). You can also change the paragraphs, checkbox text, skills, etc. Just remember to have at least the same number of elements shown above for each page.
- Feel free to add more elements if you want. There's a bonus mark for that.
